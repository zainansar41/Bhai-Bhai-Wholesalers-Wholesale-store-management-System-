# Bhai-Bhai-Wholesalers-Wholesale-store-management-System-
Welcome to the Bhai Bhai Wholesaler repository!
This repository contains the source code for a wholesale management system that includes a point-of-sale (POS) system and a debt view. The POS system allows the cashier to place orders, while the debt view stores and displays data on debt orders in an organized manner. The system is designed so that the admin can view all screens, including the POS and debt view, while the cashier can only view the POS and debt view.
In addition to the features mentioned above, the Bhai Bhai Wholesaler system also includes a dashboard where sales and profit can be calculated for any specific period of time by subtracting expenses from revenue. This allows the admin to track the performance of the wholesale shop and make informed business decisions.
The system also allows the admin to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on suppliers, employees, and customers. This allows the admin to easily manage the relationships with these parties and ensure that the wholesale shop is running smoothly.
The Erd is also available in images folder
NOTE: we use C#(window Forms as Frontend) and sql server as database backend
